**Custom Votes Redux - Modified**
=================================


This is a modified version of
[ReFlexPoison](https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=149090)â€˜s [custom
votes redux](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=235115) plugin.

Fixes and Features:
* Added vote logging.
* Added KZTimer support.
* Now utilizes Multi-Colors to support more game chat colors.
* Fixed default mapcycle resulting in an empty map list.
* Increased the map limit to 1024.
* Fixed call_notify not working and errors when a 'simple' vote is used without a convar as command.
* Added option to reset max vote passes on wave failure (TF2-MVM only).
* Fixed incorrectly adding quotes to vote results, making {VOTER_ID}, {VOTER_INDEX}, {TARGET_ID}, and {TARGET_INDEX} pretty much unusable.
* Added vote evasion detection and logging.
* Auto ban on vote evasion.
